The time complexity of Q1 is O(N).
The reason is that since both arrays must be the same length the for loop in the function will always run only n iterations in the worst case.
This exludes the error handler that prints out the error using System.out.println(), which runs at O(N^2)...

The time complexity of Q2 is O(N).
Technically the runtime is O(N+N), since we are iterating over two arrays that can have N sized sizes,
but O(N+N) = O(2N) = O(N) (not gonna prove that here, but I've taken 360C already), so the runtime is O(N).
